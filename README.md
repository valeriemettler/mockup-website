Udacity Front End Web Developer Course Project 1: Mockup to Website

I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and had to replicate the design in HTML and CSS to be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer.

The Evaluation Rubric:

Exceeds Specifications (Completely Udacious!) if your code passes the auto-evaluator with a mismatch of 1% or less

My code:  Congratulations! Tests completed successfully and you achieved a 0.94% mismatch!

Other areas evaluted by a Udacity reviewer:

Separation of Concerns: Portfolio completely separates structure (HTML) from design/style(CSS).

Code Quality: Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the Udatity HTML/CSS style guide. Code Passes W3C HTML and CSS validation.
